Static API
====

Static API is a program that generates TypeScript classes that map to a web server API defined in a DLL.

This allows you to take advantage of static typing across the web, and refactor your (internal) server API without worry of breaking anything.

This project is in the experimental phase, with a prototype currently being developed. Hopefully soon an alpha version can be released which should be mostly functional.
